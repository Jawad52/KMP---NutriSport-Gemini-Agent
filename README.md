### Dashboard Code Generated by gemini-3-flash-preview

Given Prompt:
Technical Requirements:

Data Layer: Define a Product data class (id, name, price, imageRes) and a Category data class. Create a MockData object with sample lists for promotions, top sellers, and new arrivals.

Navigation: Implement a Scaffold using rememberNavController(). Define a Screen sealed class for Home, Cart, Deal, and Profile.

UI Components:

Header: Custom TopAppBar with a circular profile image (leading) and Search/Notification IconButton icons (trailing).

Body (LazyColumn): * PromotionSlider: A HorizontalPager with vibrant gradient backgrounds.

CategoryRow: A horizontal list of circular icons with text labels.

ProductSection: A reusable horizontal scroll for 'Top Selling' and 'New Products' using cards.

RecentOrder: A high-contrast card showing the last purchased item status.

Footer: A NavigationBar linked to the NavController.

Code Style: Use functional, modular Composable functions. Ensure the theme uses darkColorScheme and utilizes Modifier.clip for rounded corners to maintain a modern look. Keep the code compatible with KMP cmp-resources

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
    Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
    folder is the appropriate location.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.
